# Unit-Converter-MIPS
## -----------------------------------------
This is a simple 32 bit MIPS program which helps the user to convert the given value to different units.

Like if you choose the length in program, program asks you to enter the value in desired unit, be it metre,kilometre...etc.

Let it be that your unit is metre and you have entered the value in metres. Then you are asked to what unit would you like the value in metre to be changed e.g. in kilo metre,centimetre...etc. Then the value is returne in your new dered unit.
